# Bank Management System

## Overview

- **Deposit Money**: Allows users to deposit money into their account.
- **Withdraw Money**: Allows users to withdraw money from their account, ensuring sufficient balance is available.
- **Exit the System**: Ends the session.

### Code Explanation

#### `Account` Class

```python
class Account:
    def __init__(self, name, balance=0):
        self.name = name
        self.balance = balance
```

This class defines an account with a name and balance. It has methods for depositing, withdrawing, and displaying the balance.

#### Methods in `Account`

- **`deposit(self, amount)`**: Deposits money into the account.
- **`withdraw(self, amount)`**: Withdraws money from the account, ensuring that the balance is sufficient.
- **`display_balance(self)`**: Displays the account balance.

#### `main()` Function

This function contains the main loop, displaying an interactive menu for the user to select operations. It also handles user input and validates account existence.

```python
def main():
    accounts = {}

    while True:
        print("\n--- Bank Management System ---")
        print("1. Create Account")
        print("2. Check Balance")
        print("3. Deposit Money")
        print("4. Withdraw Money")
        print("5. Exit")
        
        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        # Handle each menu option (create account, check balance, deposit, withdraw, exit)
```
